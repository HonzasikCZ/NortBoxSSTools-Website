# NortixSSTools Website

## [ WHAT IS IT FOR? ]

This is a simple website built for the minecraft server nortboxmc.eu.  
Its purpose is to make it easier and more **trustworthy** to download the [NortixSSTools](https://github.com/HonzasikCZ/NortixSSTools) — a collection of utility programs mainly used for the inspection of a player's computer during a screenshare (SS).

The most important tools ([Included Tools](https://github.com/HonzasikCZ/NortixSSTools?tab=readme-ov-file#-included-tools-)) are normally bundled in the full [NortixSSTools](https://github.com/HonzasikCZ/NortixSSTools) package, but if a player feels uncomfortable launching the entire toolset directly, this website offers a more transparent alternative.

You can download only the specific tools you need, directly from a verified source.
