# NortBoxSSTools Website

## [ WHAT IS IT FOR? ]

This is a simple and trustworthy website built for the minecraft server nortboxmc.eu.  
Its purpose is to make it easier and more **trustworthy** to download the **[NortBoxSSTools](https://github.com/HonzasikCZ/NortBoxSSTools)** â€” a collection of small utility programs mainly used for viewing a player's computer during a screenshare (SS).

These tools are normally bundled in the full [NortBoxSSTools](https://github.com/HonzasikCZ/NortBoxSSTools) package, but if a player feels uncomfortable launching the entire toolset directly, this website offers a more transparent alternative:  
you can download only the specific tools you need, directly from a verified source.

Each download is clearly labeled and regularly updated, ensuring both ease of use and peace of mind.
